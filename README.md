# Maze-Exercise
A self-solving maze program written in C++ utilizing OOP. 

This program creates a preset maze array. It then places a player on the board and begins trying to solve the maze. The program checks for the right position, then down, then left, then up. It pushes it's last position onto a stack incase it needs to back-track. If a dead-end is found it pops off the stack to back track.
