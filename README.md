# Maze-Exercise
A self-solving maze program written in C++.

# Description
This program is a maze solving program. It automaticalls solves a maze stored in an array. 
It has the ability to move forward, as well as backtrack using a stack. 
This program can also recognize when it the maze has no solution.
It is not object oriented, as that isn't necessary or helpful in this specific circumstance.
It does not run in a GUI, but has a clear function that gives the illusion of movement. Enter
must be pressed between each cylce of solving. This is intentional and can be removed by commenting 
out one line of code if the user does not want to see each intermediate step.
